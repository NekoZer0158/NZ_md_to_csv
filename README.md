# NZ md to csv
Plugin to convert md files to csv files and use them as translations. When you use, for example Obsidian with md files to have a better workplace for dialogues with different paths for RPGs, you don't need to manually copy-paste everything from it to your Godot project; you can just use this plugin.
Works with any file paths.
